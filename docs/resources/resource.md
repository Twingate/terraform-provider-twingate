# twingate_resource (Resource)

Resources in Twingate represent servers on the private network that clients can connect to. Resources can be defined by IP, CIDR range, FQDN, or DNS zone. For more information, see the Twingate [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/resources-and-access-nodes).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "twingate" {
  api_token = "1234567890abcdef"
  network   = "mynetwork"
}

variable "twingate_network" {
  description = "Name of twingate remote network"
  default     = "my_test_network"
}

resource "twingate_remote_network" "network" {
  name = var.twingate_network
}

resource "twingate_resource" "resource" {
  name = "network"
  address = "internal.int"
  remote_network_id = twingate_remote_network.network.id
  group_ids = ["group1"]
  protocols {
    allow_icmp = true
    tcp  {
      policy = "RESTRICTED"
      ports = ["80", "82-83"]
    }
    udp {
      policy = "ALLOW_ALL"
    }
  }
}
```

- **remote_network_id** (String) Remote Network ID where the Resource lives

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) Autogenerated ID of the Resource, encoded in base64

<a id="nestedblock--protocols"></a>
### Nested Schema for `protocols`

Required:
