# twingate_resource (Resource)

Resources in Twingate represent servers on the private network that clients can connect to. Resources can be defined by IP, CIDR range, FQDN, or DNS zone. For more information, see the Twingate [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/resources-and-access-nodes).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "twingate" {
  api_token = "1234567890abcdef"
  network   = "mynetwork"
}

resource "twingate_remote_network" "aws_network" {
  name = "aws_remote_network"
}

resource "twingate_resource" "resource" {
  name = "network"
  address = "internal.int"
  remote_network_id = twingate_remote_network.aws_network.id
  group_ids = ["group1"]
  protocols {
    allow_icmp = true
    tcp  {
      policy = "RESTRICTED"
      ports = ["80", "82-83"]
    }
    udp {
      policy = "ALLOW_ALL"
    }
  }
}
```
