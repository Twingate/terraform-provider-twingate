# twingate_resource (Resource)

Resources in Twingate represent servers on the private network that clients can connect to. Resources can be defined by IP, CIDR range, FQDN, or DNS zone. For more information, see the Twingate [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/resources-and-access-nodes).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "twingate" {
  api_token = "1234567890abcdef"
  network   = "mynetwork"
}

resource "twingate_remote_network" "aws_network" {
  name = "aws_remote_network"
}

resource "twingate_group" "aws" {
  name = "aws_group"
}

resource "twingate_resource" "resource" {
  name = "network"
  address = "internal.int"
  remote_network_id = twingate_remote_network.aws_network.id
  group_ids = [twingate_group.aws.id]
  protocols {
    allow_icmp = true
    tcp  {
      policy = "RESTRICTED"
      ports = ["80", "82-83"]
    }
    udp {
      policy = "ALLOW_ALL"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) The Resource's IP/CIDR or FQDN/DNS zone
- `name` (String) The name of the Resource
- `remote_network_id` (String) Remote Network ID where the Resource lives

### Optional

- `group_ids` (Set of String) List of Group IDs that have permission to access the Resource, cannot be generated by Terraform and must be retrieved from the Twingate Admin Console or API
- `protocols` (Block List, Max: 1) Restrict access to certain protocols and ports. By default or when this argument is not defined, there is no restriction, and all protocols and ports are allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--protocols))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Autogenerated ID of the Resource, encoded in base64

<a id="nestedblock--protocols"></a>
### Nested Schema for `protocols`

Required:

- `tcp` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--protocols--tcp))
- `udp` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--protocols--udp))

Optional:

- `allow_icmp` (Boolean) Whether to allow ICMP (ping) traffic

<a id="nestedblock--protocols--tcp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `protocols.tcp`

Required:

- `policy` (String) Whether to allow or deny all ports, or restrict protocol access within certain port ranges: Can be `RESTRICTED` (only listed ports are allowed), `ALLOW_ALL`, or `DENY_ALL`

Optional:

- `ports` (List of String) List of port ranges between 1 and 65535 inclusive, in the format `100-200` for a range, or `8080` for a single port


<a id="nestedblock--protocols--udp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `protocols.udp`

Required:

- `policy` (String) Whether to allow or deny all ports, or restrict protocol access within certain port ranges: Can be `RESTRICTED` (only listed ports are allowed), `ALLOW_ALL`, or `DENY_ALL`

Optional:

- `ports` (List of String) List of port ranges between 1 and 65535 inclusive, in the format `100-200` for a range, or `8080` for a single port
