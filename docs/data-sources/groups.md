# twingate_groups (Data Source)

Groups are how users are authorized to access Resources. For more information, see Twingate's [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/groups).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "twingate_groups" "foo" {
  name = "<your group's name>"
}

# Group names are not constrained to be unique within Twingate,
# so it is possible that this data source will return multiple list items.
```
