  Resources in Twingate represent servers on the private network that clients can connect to. Resources can be defined by IP, CIDR range, FQDN, or DNS zone. For more information, see the Twingate documentation https://docs.twingate.com/docs/resources-and-access-nodes.

# twingate_resources (Data Source)

Resources in Twingate represent servers on the private network that clients can connect to. Resources can be defined by IP, CIDR range, FQDN, or DNS zone. For more information, see the Twingate [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/resources-and-access-nodes).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "twingate_resources" "foo" {
  name = "<your resource's name>"
  #  name_regexp = "<regular expression of resource name>"
  #  name_contains = "<a string in the resource name>"
  #  name_exclude = "<your resource's name to exclude>"
  #  name_prefix = "<prefix of resource name>"
  #  name_suffix = "<suffix of resource name>"

  # tags = {
  #   environment = "dev"
  # }
}

# Resource names are not constrained to be unique within Twingate,
# so it is possible that this data source will return multiple list items.
```
