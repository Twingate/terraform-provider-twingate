data "twingate_dlp_policies" "all" {
  name = "<your DLP policy's name>"
  #  name_regexp = "<regular expression of DLP policy name>"
  #  name_contains = "<a string in the DLP policy name>"
  #  name_exclude = "<your DLP policy's name to exclude>"
  #  name_prefix = "<prefix of DLP policy name>"
  #  name_suffix = "<suffix of DLP policy name>"
}
```
