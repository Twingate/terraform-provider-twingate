# Twingate Provider

The Twingate provider can be used with [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com) to manage your Remote Networks, Connectors, and Resources through Terraform.

~> **Warning** Using the Twingate Terraform provider will cause any secrets, such as Connector tokens or Twingate API keys, that are managed in Terraform to be persisted in both Terraform's state file and in any generated plan files. If malicious attackers obtain these credentials, they could intercept network traffic intended for your private network or cause a denial of service event. For any Terraform module that reads or writes Twingate secrets, these files should be treated as sensitive and protected accordingly.

## Twingate Setup

You need an API key to use Twingate's Terraform provider. See our [documentation](https://docs.twingate.com/docs/api-overview) for more details about creating an API key. You will also need your network ID, or the prefix of your Twingate URL that you use to sign into the Admin Console. For example, if your URL is `autoco.twingate.com` your network ID is `autoco`.
